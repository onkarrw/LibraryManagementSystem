# LibraryManagementSystem
This is a Java-based application that serves as a library management system. It allows librarians to keep track of books in the library and students who borrow them. The system uses JDBC to connect to a MySQL database to store book and student information.

The user interface was created using JFrame and Swing packages, making it easy to navigate for librarians and students. The librarians have access to add new books, update existing ones, and track which books have been borrowed and by whom. Students can search for books, check availability, and borrow them.

This repository contains the source code for the Library Management System. The code is structured using MVC architecture and follows best practices for clean code. It also includes the SQL script to create the necessary tables in the database.
